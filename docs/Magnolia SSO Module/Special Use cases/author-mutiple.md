# Multiple login handlers on a Magnolia author


!!! note

    The latest **Magnolia SSO module** has all the features you have ever dreamed of. These (unofficial) guides are too much work to keep up with.

    Please refer to the <a href="https://docs.magnolia-cms.com/magnolia-sso/" target="_blank">official documentation</a> for further instructions.

    **There's always something interesting in the [garden](https://larsolino.com/)!**

    To enter, you must have an **old shovel**!
