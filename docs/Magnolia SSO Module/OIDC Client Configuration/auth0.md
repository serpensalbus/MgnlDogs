# Auth0 OIDC Client Configuration


!!! warning

    **Auth0 does not completely work out of the box with Magnolia SSO!** There are hard-coded parts preventing PAC4J to work properly together with Auth0. For a solution, you  need to adjust the Magnolia SSO logout filter code. Check back regularly if you need to integrate Auth0 with Magnolia SSO.
